#summary Introduction to KREX

= Introduction =

KREX is an acronym for Kettle Repository Export. It is a collection of Kettle (a.k.a. Pentaho Data Integration) jobs and transformations to export the contents of a Kettle database repository to individual .kjb and .ktr files.

= Details =

To get started:
* Check out this project's sources and place them in a directory on the file system. 
* Download Kettle 3.2 (currently Milestone 1 release) 
* Start spoon and open "export_repository_to_files.kjb". This is the main job.
* Open the set_source_repo_and_target_directory Transformation (1st entry after start)
  * Open "Set Source Repository", the first step in that transformation
  * Set appropriate variables for pdi_repo_to_export, pdi_repo_user, pdi_repo_password and Save
* run "export_repository_to_files.kjb"

If all goes well, you should get a directory called pdi_repo_export in your home directory (/home/<username> on *nix, and usually C:\Documents and Settings\<username> on win*), and in that dir you should find a subdir named after the repository name you specified. Inside that subdir, the entire directory tree of the repository should be present containing the jobs and transformations as .kjb and .ktr files respectively.
